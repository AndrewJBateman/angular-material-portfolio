App Engine is a Platform As A Service (PaaS), so Google manages all the hardware and networking infrastructure. You pay for just what you use, so you can focus on your application. It has built-in services, including NoSQL databases, load balancing, health checks, memory cache & user-login/authentication.

App Engine works with Ruby, PHP, .NET, Go, C#, Java, Node.js & Python. It is also possible to use a container such as Docker with any programming language or library, such as Haskell, Fortran, Erlang, Perl, Elixir or Cobol. There are 2 types of App Engine environments; Standard and Flexible. Google Cloud Shell command 'gcloud app deploy' will start the process of deploying an app.

App Engine Standard Environment offers easy deployment of apps, workload autoscaling, a free daily quota and pricing based on how much is used. However, a sandbox model is used - only the flexible environment allows the user to specify the type of container the app runs in (e.g. Docker). 

The Standard Environment instance starts in milliseconds, whereas the Flexible one takes minutes. Only the Flexible environment provides SSH access to the virtual machine and can write to local disk as well as provide support for 3rd-party binaries. However a Kubernetes Engine will allow the user maximum control of their app.
