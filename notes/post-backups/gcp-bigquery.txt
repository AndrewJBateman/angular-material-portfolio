BigQuery is a low-cost virtual relational data warehouse service provided by Google Cloud with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) SQL that can run queries on petabytes of your data at super-speed. It is easy to set up and manage and can give valuable insights into business data. Data can also be read and written using Cloud Dataflow, Hadoop and Spark. However BigQuery is optimised for reads and not for high-volume writes. BigQuery is not transactional database. Data can be specifed to be held in Europe, Asia or US regions, so it is not a global database.

Machine Learning (ML) models are available for data analysis using basic SQL commands. ML can be applied from the web UI, the BigQuery command line (python-based) or REST API and also from a Jupyter notebook/similar platform. Some of the models available include linear, binary logistic or multiclass logistic regression, K-means or TensorFlow. 

There is also the super-fast Business Intelligence (BI) analysis service. You will need to purchase BI Engine capacity for the project using a reservation from 2GB to 10GB. There is a free non-production tier in Data Studio for up to 1GB. You can build dashboards and reports for real-time data analysis but only using Data Studio. Pricing can be flat-rate or on-demand per GB of data processed.

BigQuery Geospacial Information Service (GIS) allows analysis and visualisation of location data, using geography data types and standard SQL geography functions (constructors, parsers, formatters, transformations, predicates, accessors, measurements - such as ST_DISTANCE - and aggregate functions). ST_GEOGPOINT requires that latitudes be in the range [-90, 90] and longitudes be in the range [-180, 180].

BigQuery has a 99.9% service level agreement and is used by UPS for package volume forecasting. Other customers include Dow Jones, American Eagle and 20th Century Fox etc...
