Title: REST v SOAP 
Subtitle: Compared
Content:
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (REpresentational State Transfer) are 2 completely different Application Programming Interface (API) technologies.

REST is reliable, fast and uses less bandwidth. It uses the client-server principle and the highly compatible Javascript Object Notation (JSON) data format, although XML can also be used. Security-wise is supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), uses a single common interface and is very simple to use. It is lightweight and non-dynamic data can be cached. A client does not need any knowledge of a REST API to interact with it (Stateless existance is a REST specification). 

SOAP is much more complex as it has enterprise-level security standards. It supports SSL security and has Web Services Security (WS-Security with the use of security tokens and secure messaging). SOAP is Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation & Durability (ACID) compliant so is suitable for database and other important transactions such as financial. SOAP data relies exclusively on the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and cannot be cached. A client interacting with a SOAP API will be very closely coupled with the server. 

SOAP uses a wide range of communications protocols, including: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Trasmission Control Protocol (TCP), HTTP, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) & the Java Message Service (JMS). Any programming language can use SOAP. However SOAP does not use JSON, only XML data.
