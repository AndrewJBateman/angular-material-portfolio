      <p class="main-para">I have been studying programming part-time for 3 years, completing a range of projects, online courses & tutorials from FreeCodeCamp, Treehouse, Udemy and Youtube etc. I have also learnt a lot from reading programming-related blogs and articles. I currently have <span *ngIf="profile" class="repo-text"> {{ repos }}</span> repositories on Github (last updated: <span *ngIf="profile" class="repo-text">{{ lastUpdated | dateConvert }}</span>) with a mixture of my own projects, tutorial code and forked projects of interest.

      <p class="main-para">There is more about my programming and engineering in the cards below. The aim of this website is to showcase some of my projects and explain a little about me, without repeating what is on my Linkedin profile or CV. This website has been a big project in itself - see the last of the cards below for info.</p>

      <p class="main-para">This site has a technical blog that I will be updating regularly with categories including Programming Development (Dev), IT and Engineering (Eng). I welcome comments - just go to the Contact page to send me a message :-).</p>
