        >I have been studying programming part-time for a number of years,
        completing lots of online courses & tutorials from FreeCodeCamp,
        Treehouse, Udemy, Coursera and Youtube etc. I also recently gained
        Google Associate Cloud Engineer Certification. I have

        repositories on Github with a mixture of my own projects and tutorial
        code.

        Programming was not new to me as I previously worked for 20 years as an
        Electronic/Electrical Engineer in the UK, Spain and finally in Norway
        (including 2 years in Hammerfest, the Northermost town in the world).
        After this I returned to Spain to look after the family (including a
        child with a rare disease called Landau Kleffner) & continue
        programming.

        There is more about my Programming, Engineering & IT below. The aim of
        this website is to show some of my projects and a little about me,
        without repeating what is in Linkedin. This website was built with an
        Angular front-end and a Firebase backend - see Projects for more info.
        This site has a technical blog with categories: Programming Development,
        IT and Engineering.
