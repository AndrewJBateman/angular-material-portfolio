Ionic: This is the one I know well. It comes with UI elements like forms, cards, lists, tab bars and navigation menus and lots more out of the box. Uses CSS/SCSS, HTML & Typescript. Even better is used in PhoneGap. Mostly used with Angular but also available now to use with React and Vue. Uses Cordova plugins to interface with the phone's camera, GPS, Storage, Network status etc.
